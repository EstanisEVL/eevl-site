My interest in web development started back in 2015 when I decided to try building a custom web site for my parent's business â€” turns out trying to modify different themes and plugins left me with a huge need to learn more about this world!",

    "Currently, I devote myself to the wonderful process of becoming a Full-stack Developer. I understand that this process never truly ends, and that's what I love about it! So far I have WordPress, HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Bootstrap, Sass, Git/GitHub and React JS under my belt. I want to keep expanding that belt, adding Typescript, Node.JS, Express.js, MySQL and MongoDB.
